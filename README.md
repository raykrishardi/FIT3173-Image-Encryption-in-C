# Image Encryption with 128-bit AES in ECB and CBC mode of operations

# About the project:
This project is part of my first assignment for the FIT3173 (Software Security) unit. The program uses OpenSSL library to encrypt the original image (pic_original.bmp) with 128-bit AES in ECB and CBC mode of operations. The encrypted images with the appropriate cipher block mode of operations are named ecb.bmp and cbc.bmp.
