# Image Encryption in C

# About the project:
This project is part of my first assignment for the FIT3173 (Software Security) unit. The program uses OpenSSL library to encrypt the original image (pic_original.bmp) in AES ECB and AES CBC mode respectively. The encrypted images with the appropriate cipher block mode of operations are named ecb.bmp and cbc.bmp.
